	abstract = {Public Key Infrastructure ({PKI}) generates and distributes digital certificates to provide the root of trust for securing digital networking systems. To continue securing digital networking in the quantum era, {PKI} should transition to use quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms. The cryptography community is developing quantum-resistant primitives/algorithms, studying, and analyzing them for cryptanalysis and improvements. National Institute of Standards and Technology ({NIST}) selected finalist algorithms for the post-quantum digital signature cipher standardization, which are Dilithium, Falcon, and Rainbow. We study and analyze the feasibility and the processing performance of these algorithms in memory/size and time/speed when used for {PKI}, including the key generation from the {PKI} end entities (e.g., a {HTTPS}/{TLS} server), the signing, and the certificate generation by the certificate authority within the {PKI}. The transition to post-quantum from the classical ciphers incur changes in the parameters in the {PKI}, for example, Rainbow I significantly increases the certificate size by 163 times when compared with {RSA} 3072. Nevertheless, we learn that the current X.509 supports the {NIST} post-quantum digital signature ciphers and that the ciphers can be modularly adapted for {PKI}. According to our empirical implementations-based study, the post-quantum ciphers can increase the certificate verification time cost compared to the current classical cipher and therefore the verification overheads require careful considerations when using the post-quantum-cipher-based certificates.},
