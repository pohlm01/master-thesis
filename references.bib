	abstract = {In the middle of the night on September 2, 2011, the Dutch Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations held an emergency press conference. {DigiNotar}, a Certificate Authority ({CA}), had been electronically ‘broken into’ and as a result intruders had managed to generate falsified certificates. As a {CA}, {DigiNotar} issued digital certificates to secure digital communication, but as a result of the breach the authenticity of such certificates could no longer be verified. The Dutch government subsequently revoked its trust in all certificates issued by {DigiNotar}. This was the beginning of the first digital disaster in the Netherlands. As a pioneering disaster, this article focuses on the implications of {DigiNotar} as a vital case study for future scenarios of digital disaster management. The main focus of this article is on the underlying ‘weaknesses’ of the {DigiNotar} incident, which allowed the situation to evolve from a problem into a disaster. These include lack of oversight, lack of security attention and risk awareness and the absence of an effective mitigation strategy. By identifying and subsequently analyzing the underlying problems, this article aims to demonstrate how future situations can be better contained if sufficient attention is granted to these factors and subsequent changes are introduced.},

	abstract = {Public Key Infrastructure ({PKI}) generates and distributes digital certificates to provide the root of trust for securing digital networking systems. To continue securing digital networking in the quantum era, {PKI} should transition to use quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms. The cryptography community is developing quantum-resistant primitives/algorithms, studying, and analyzing them for cryptanalysis and improvements. National Institute of Standards and Technology ({NIST}) selected finalist algorithms for the post-quantum digital signature cipher standardization, which are Dilithium, Falcon, and Rainbow. We study and analyze the feasibility and the processing performance of these algorithms in memory/size and time/speed when used for {PKI}, including the key generation from the {PKI} end entities (e.g., a {HTTPS}/{TLS} server), the signing, and the certificate generation by the certificate authority within the {PKI}. The transition to post-quantum from the classical ciphers incur changes in the parameters in the {PKI}, for example, Rainbow I significantly increases the certificate size by 163 times when compared with {RSA} 3072. Nevertheless, we learn that the current X.509 supports the {NIST} post-quantum digital signature ciphers and that the ciphers can be modularly adapted for {PKI}. According to our empirical implementations-based study, the post-quantum ciphers can increase the certificate verification time cost compared to the current classical cipher and therefore the verification overheads require careful considerations when using the post-quantum-cipher-based certificates.},
